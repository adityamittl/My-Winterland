# My Winterland

## 💡 Inspiration

This witer is stressful enough without holiday shopping! From buying products entirely online, to ensuring a fully remote delivery, there are a lot of added stressors this holiday season. We’ve created a simple, easy to use, and effective solution to help you manage your tracking packages and spending winter holidays easily.

## 💻 What it does

My Winterland is a simple, easy to use, and effective solution to help you manage your tracking packages and spending winter holidays easily.
The application allowing users to easily track their gift lists, find recipes, recommend movies to watch with whole family and maintain budget.

<!-- First, enter in your budget. Then input the people you're thinking about this holiday season. From there, add gifts to your wishlist for each person, either manually, or using our partnering Chrome extension. The extension is built to make it easy to find gifts for those you love. Log in to Google. Surf Amazon, and then find a cool gift for that one special friend. If there's one that you would think you want to buy, you can add that gift to your wishlist for that friend. Later, if you choose to buy that gift, you can manage your bought gifts and balance your budget in your gift hub on the giftn web app. Shopping made easy! Once you do buy all those gifts, keep your tracking numbers stored in our tracking number hub. With COVID, gift giving might look a little different—-you may be sending gifts straight to your friends or loved one's houses. With this in mind, you can send an auto-generated email sending your friend or loved one some holiday cheer (along with the tracking number of the package and a personalized message, of course). It is is super easy to get started with giftn! -->

## ☁️ Use of Linode

- We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake! Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.

## 💾 Use of CockroachDB
