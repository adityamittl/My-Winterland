# My Winterland

## 💡 Inspiration

This witer is stressful enough without holiday shopping! From buying products entirely online, to ensuring a fully remote delivery, there are a lot of added stressors this holiday season. We’ve created a simple, easy to use, and effective solution to help you manage your tracking packages and spending winter holidays easily. <br>
Finding amazing holiday recipies and recommended Netflix movies and shows personalized to user's taste acts as a cherry on cake.

## 💻 What it does

My Winterland is a simple, easy to use, and effective solution to help you manage your tracking packages and spending winter holidays easily.
The application allows users to easily track their gift lists, find recipes, recommend movies to watch with whole family and maintain budget. <br>
You can also add your budget and set your delivery address. Once you’ve added your gift lists, you can start tracking your packages. 

## 🤔 How it Works?

To begin, input your budget. Then list the folks you're thinking of throughout the holidays. Then, for each individual, add things to your wishlist. Browse Amazon for a unique present for that one special buddy. If there's something you believe you'd want to get for a buddy, you may put it on your wishlist. If you decide to buy the present later, you may manage your purchased gifts and budget in your gift hub on our app. Shopping has never been easier! Keep your tracking numbers in our tracking number hub once you've purchased all of those presents.
Gift giving with COVID may take on a new form—you may be sending gifts directly to your friends' or loved ones' homes. With this in mind, you may send an auto-generated email to a friend or loved one wishing them a happy holiday season (along with the tracking number of the package and a personalised message, of course).

## ⚙️How we built it

- ML: Python, Skikit-Learn
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Django
- Database: CockroachDB
- Linode: Hosting and storage
- Send email: Twilio

## 📧 Use of Twilio

- We used Twilio to send emails to our users. Twilio is a cloud-based SMS service that allows us to send text messages to our users. We used Twilio to send emails to our users. Twilio is a cloud-based SMS service that allows us to send text messages to our users.

## ☁️ Use of Linode

- We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake! Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.

## 💾 Use of CockroachDB

- We have used CockroachDB as a primary database because it is an easy-to-use, open-source and indestructible SQL database.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we ran into was integration of all these features. We had to build a complex, dynamic, and responsive frontend that allowed users to easily manage their gift lists, find recipes, recommend movies to watch with whole family and maintain budget.
